            <h3>The Ghost of Shirley</h3>
            <p>For ten years, the school sat in silence after the 2013 collapse. What was once a place of laughter, a vibrant center for early childhood development became a ghost of the community’s hopes. Our journey began here—not with a budget, but with a scrappy laptop and a vision to bring life back to these walls and reclaim this space for the next generation.</p>

        <h3>Hard Work & Real Results</h3>
        <p>Revitalization required more than just funding; it required grit. Securing a grant early 2024 from the <a href="https://www.nda.org.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="donor-link">National Development Agency</a> was just the dawn of the long anticipated new beginning. It boosted the real transformation that happened on the ground, led by local hands. From clearing decade-old thickets and dangerous trees threatening the structure to securing water through a new borehole, we didn't just paint walls; we rebuilt a sanctuary.</p>

            <h3>The Reason We Fight</h3>
            <p>This is why it matters. In 2025, we saw our first small group of graduates walk through these doors. A living proof that resilience pays off, but the work is fragile. We are building not just a school, but a sustainable future. Though enrolment is small, the impact is massive. These faces are evidence that Shirley Pre-School is back—and we aren't done yet.</p>
